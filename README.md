## About Me

My fascination with technology began not in a classroom, but from a desire to connect people. In 2012, this led me to build a custom social network from scratch. That project was my real-world university, teaching me the ins and outs of PHP, server architecture, and the endless possibilities of the web.

Today, I channel that same passion into engineering robust and beautiful digital experiences across platforms. Beyond the screen, I'm an avid explorerâ€”whether it's discovering new technologies, getting lost in a good book, or debugging my life with a cup of coffee. I believe that curiosity is the engine of creativity.

> #### User-First Design
> Technology should serve people. I prioritize creating intuitive, accessible, and engaging experiences for the end-user.

> #### Pragmatic Problem-Solving
